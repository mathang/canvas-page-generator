# Canvas Page Generator

A lightweight Canvas LMS page generator built by Associate Professor Ross Clark with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Handlebars templates. Fill out the form, generate HTML, and paste it directly into Canvas.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs at http://localhost:5173 by default.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Pushes to the `main` branch trigger the included GitHub Actions workflow, which builds the project and publishes it to GitHub Pages. After the workflow succeeds, the site will be available at `https://<yourusername>.github.io/canvas-page-generator/` once Pages is enabled in the repository settings.
